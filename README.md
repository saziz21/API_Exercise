# API_Exercise

Using the most timely and accurate data available on [https://www.census.gov/en.html](https://www.census.gov/en.html), write a python script that pulls the following poverty data for Harris County, TX in the year 2018:

- Estimate of the number of people under the age of 18 in poverty
- Estimate of the number of people of any age in poverty
- Estimate of the median household income

Your script should then write this data to a .csv file, including appropriately named headers. When finished, push your code to a public git repo.

**Requirements**:

- Use an api key to authenticate your requests
- Use the [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library (no custom libraries that pull Census data)
